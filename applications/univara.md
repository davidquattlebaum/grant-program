## Project Overview 

- Project: Univara
- Team Name: Univara, LLC 
- Payment Address: 0x08bB8438Ab68B4267908116f7bFe140770ccc092

### Overview

Univara is an enterprise-level NFT marketplace and transaction engine platform created specifically to address the needs of enterprise level and corporate customers. 

Our goal is to provide a user-friendly, highly responsive NFT marketplace and transaction engine which will allow for custom contract creation, as well as white labeling curated NFTs for sale under existing and future brands. 

This will include IRL art galleries as well as transactional partners for supply chain or other enterprise business related NFTs. 

Univara is not only interested in building on the VeChainThor blockchain, but has been actively building since August of 2021 with the intent to launch exclusively on VeChain.

The enterprise-level speed, security, transactional stability and uptime we foresee being necessary in the corporate world mandates a layer 1 blockchain like VeChain, and there is no alternative which comes close. In addition, enterprise clients seek several functionalities which VeChain already offers, such as fee delegation, multi-task transactions, and controllable transaction lifecycles.

VeChain also meets the demands of being a sustainable and green blockchain, which we deem mandatory for the decades to come.

#####  Technology Stack
Front End:
- React.js

Back End:
- Node.js
- Connex
- MySQL Server for Relational supportive data
- Pinata for IPFS Storage

Additional Components/Services:
- RocketChat Server for site managed communication

### Ecosystem Fit
In phase one, our marketplace will functionally appear similar to other NFT marketplaces to the common user.

However, throughout subsequent phases, we will deploy state-of-the-art features not yet seen on VeChain to allow for more than Art to be exchanged on our platform. A key component of this effort will be a Contract Configurator which will allow for a more interactive and dynamic approach to building out smart contracts, enabling enterprise-level clients to utilize the platform at scale with more efficient completion from beginning to deployment.

In its final state, Univara aims to be the largest NFT transaction engine in the world.
